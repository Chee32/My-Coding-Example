# My-Coding-Example
an example of a Wordpress plugin I have developed for emboss that handles working with APIs and Databases

This plugin was created to allow for a Wordpress website to connect to a payment gateway of Propay and ProtectPay.  It works with Propay's API and Wordpress's database to create and record merchants, payers, and payments.
